My situation will be reproduced. When the mintNft method is called on the front end, an error will be returned: AnchorError occurred. Error Code: InstructionFallbackNotFound. Error Number: 101. Error Message : Fallback functions are not supported.

I'm a newbie and this is totally bugging me, thanks for your time
